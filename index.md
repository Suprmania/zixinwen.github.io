I am an undergraduate student in Statistics department at UIBE in Beijing. My research interest lies in deep learning theory. More specifically, I focus on the optimization behaviors and provable statistical guarantees for deep learning. I am also skilled at conducting experiments via major deep learning frameworks in python, say PyTorch, TensorFlow and MxNet.
